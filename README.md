# Dijstra-s-algorithm-for-the-single-source-minimum-path-problem
CS 302 - Write a program which implments Dijstra's algorithm for the single source minimum path problem on a weighted directed graph with no negative weights.

Use Linked lists under priority queues and use vector to contain them in order to put the queues in order. From there, implment Dijstra's algorithm
